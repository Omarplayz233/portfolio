This is **Deta Surf**, just my 2nd browser that i need, let's start:
## 1. What is Deta Surf?
Deta Surf is a web browser based on [ElectronJS](https://electronjs.org/?utm_source=omarplayz) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/?utm_source=omarplayz), and the backend based on [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/?utm_source=omarplayz), still the browser has lots of cool features.
## 2. My journey on using Deta Surf
Let's go back when [Deta Space](https://deta.space/?utm_source=omarplayz) was discontinued, it was a great serverless platform, and of COURSE for free, i was uploading some svelte apps, and made some events, idk, just some basics coding stuff

I heard that it discontinued, and they are working on an **AI powered browser**, [**Deta Surf**](https://deta.space/#:~:text=What%27s%20next%20for,you%20popped%20by.) and here's [the link](https://deta.surf/?utm_source=omarplayz) if you're interested, so basically i got access, and here's some stuff that i like and **i don't like**, and some stuff that **need to be improved/added**
## 3. Cool features:
### 1. AI
AI is now getting advanced, with some features, like being able to read PDF files, or even websites!

And yet, the AI is **very smart** (cuz it can browse the internet, while Gemini sucks (trained on Reddit's Database))

As a 14 year old, i really need it for robotics, art and science.
### 2. Ricing
Just made a simple ricing, like you see at the top

i just like watching steins gate, who agrees with me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The UI itself is yet, very clean, and still a **BIT** better than the previous versions, but needs a little bit of work.
## 4. IDL (**I** **D**on't **L**ike)

### 1. Dancing Buttons (very funny)
[have a look](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1305204343028318348/1305204343225585764/2024-11-10_17-12-08.mp4?ex=67605244&is=675f00c4&hm=1b9f6e55cc235baa4154a1f0b7d049916bd58ccdce410be5333bb34980aa9941&), so basically, it made me laugh non-stop, like that's the first time that i **LAUGH** at a bug üò≠

### 2. OpenAI Externel Links Compatibility
so, i used [Together AI API](https://docs.togther.ai/docs/openai-api-compatibility) to message my `meta-llama/Llama-Vision-Free` cuz it has text and image based stuff, right? well i used the custom AI provider:
![AI Custom Provider](/blog/api-issue.png)

and it returned nothing, LIKE EMPTY!

## 3. The stuff that need to be improved/added
### 1. Custom CSS
I still remember one time, on Deta Space, THAT blew my mind, is just custom CSS, well basically you need a knowledge ON how to code HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to code Custom CSS, nowadays they use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?utm_source=omarplayz) to let them code

BUT Deta Surf doesn't have it, i wish if they added it
### 2. Use the [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef) instead of ElectronJS
So, ElectronJS is very slow, LIKE REALLY SLOW at loading the html content, so CEF/Chromium Embedded Framework should solve the speed

### 3. Integrate [Ollama API](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md?utm_source=omarplayz) with Deta Surf
So, Ollama is a local AI based on Python, that can run some local AI models like Llama 3, CodeLlama, etc. on your computer (or even a supercomputer!), SO if they added it, that's just really amazing cuz how the **FUCK** do i run a local AI

### 4. Extensions (IMPORTANT)
Extensions is JUST my favorite option to add if i was building a web browser, BUT ElectronJS just limits the capability to run extensions, you might have to look it up yourself...

## Conclusion
so i would recommend the browser FOR student, enthuasiats, AND engineers, just to get their work and stuff ready with AI, BUT if you want, i mean REALLY want extensions, then you gotta build yourself a CEF based web browser.

I'll give Deta Surf an 8/10, still needs some work and improvements, i hope the team read my honest review! cuz it really needs SOME improvements
